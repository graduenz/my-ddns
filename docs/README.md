# MyDDNS

MyDDNS is a tool that implements Dynamic DNS and continually updates DNS entries on supported registrars.

The project was created with the intention to publicly host side projects on a home server that does not have a static IP. It is open source, free, MIT-licensed, [available on GitHub](https://github.com/graduenz/my-ddns/).
